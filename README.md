> Maternal bias on the histone modifications in hybrid rice endosperm

## Introduction

This is a set of in-house scripts specifically for the integrated data analysis of ChIP-seq datasets and SNP bias in hybrid rice from endosperm from the reciprocal crosses between Nipponbare (Nip) and 9311. The detailed data processing, resuts and discoveries will be available on Nature Plants 2023 (NPLANTS-211112076), by Wu et al. in Ming Luo's team at CSIRO.
